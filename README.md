## What works?
Hamburger menu, search completion, mapview annotations, data encoding, writing, decoding and reading.
## Improvements
MapKit sometimes can't find queries that it autocompletes itself.\

It would diminish the perceived integrity of the application to show an alert view saying that the location cannot be found, because the application has just autocompleted it as a suggestion. Maybe the suggestions can be searched one by one and the ones giving an error can be filtered out. This will, however, use more data.
